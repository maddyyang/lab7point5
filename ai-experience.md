# AI Tool Experience: GitHub Copilot Reflection

## Using GitHub Copilot for My Project
For this lab, I used GitHub Copilot to assist with fetching data from an external API and integrating it into my 11ty project using Alpine.js. I also tested how well Copilot could help with styling the fetched data using Tailwind CSS.

## Task 1: Fetching API Data
When I asked Copilot to generate a `fetch` request for JSONPlaceholder, it provided a basic structure that mostly worked. However, I had to adjust some parts to fit within my Alpine.js setup. While Copilot helped speed up the process, it sometimes made unnecessary suggestions.

Generated a valid fetch request.  
Needed slight modifications to work with Alpine.js.

## Task 2: Styling with Tailwind CSS
Copilot also assisted with adding Tailwind CSS classes to style the fetched API data. It suggested reasonable class combinations, but some were overly complex or unnecessary. I had to simplify them to make the design cleaner.

Provided a good starting point for styling.  
Occasionally added extra, redundant classes.

## Final Thoughts
GitHub Copilot was useful for quickly generating boilerplate code and suggesting ideas, but I still needed to manually refine its output. It saved me time on repetitive tasks but wasnâ€™t perfect. I see it as a helpful assistant rather than a replacement for writing code myself.
